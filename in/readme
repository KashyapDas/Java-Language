In java we donot need destructor as it uses a Garbage Collector(GC) that automatically delete the object that are no longer referenced or unused

Since, memory management is automatic, therefore we need no to use destructor in java. But, in the early time there was a method called finialize() which was like destructor but now it was deprecated.

Now, instead of using destructor, java provide try,catch,finally block for auto closing resources like file, socket.io, DB connections etc.
